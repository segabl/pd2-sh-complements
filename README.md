# Streamlined Heisting Complements

Complementary skill, perk and weapon changes to go with [Streamlined Heisting](https://github.com/segabl/pd2-streamlined-heisting).

## Skill changes

### Mastermind

#### Medic

- Combat Medic
  - Ace
    - Changed revive health increase to be additive
    - Revive health increase 30% → 15%

*Since this percentage was multiplied with the revive health percentage, the ace version of this skill was not doing much at high difficulties.*
*Changing it to add to the revive health percentage and in turn reducing the amount will make it much more useful on higher difficulties.*

- Inspire
  - Ace
    - Cooldown 20s → 40s

*Inspire's cooldown is low enough to not really matter, the time it takes for someone to go into custody when downed is longer than the cooldown of the skill.*
*Increasing the cooldown makes Inspire usage more strategic and less abusable.*

#### Controller

- Forced Friendship
  - Ace
    - Damage absorption 0.5 → 1.5
    - Max stacks 8 → 4

*Keeping that many hostages for a measly 4 damage absorption is not really practical and not even possible on heists without civilians or after civilians are gone.*
*Reducing the stacks makes it possible to keep up the buff through police hostages and slightly increasing the total absorption should make it more useful.*

- Confident
  - Basic
    - Removed intimidation duration upgrade

*Confident increases intimidation duration which is something that Stockholm Syndrome claims to do.*
*Swapping out the upgrades and moving the duration upgrade to Stockholm Syndrome makes more sense.*

- Stockholm Syndrome
  - Basic
    - Added missing intimidation duration upgrade

*See notes on Confident.*

- Joker
  - Basic
    - Added 75% base damage reduction
  - Ace
    - Damage increase is now accurate to the description instead of a 35% damage penalty without the skill

*Adding a base damage reduction makes basic Jokers a little more useful and compensates for the reductions in Partners In Crime.*

- Partners In Crime
  - Basic
    - Damage reduction 45% → 75%
  - Ace
    - Damage reduction 54% → 15%

*Partners In Crime is giving a bit too much survivability to Jokers on top of having badly distributed balance between Basic and Ace version.*
*Shifting some of the power and reducing the total damage reduction in exchange for higher damage reduction at base will make the basic version more useful.*

#### Sharpshooter

- Ammo Efficiency
  - Basic
    - Ammo return 1 → 2

*This skill doesn't really feel impactful, shooting enemies at long range is usually still a net loss of ammo.*
*Increasing the ammo return allows gaining all ammo spent back when played optimally which should make it feel more rewarding.*

- Aggressive Reload
  - Ace
    - Reload speed increase 100% → 75%

*The reload speed increase of Aggressive Reload seems a bit extreme for something as basic as hitting headshots.*

### Enforcer

#### Shotgunner

- Far Away
  - Basic and Ace skill swapped
  - Ace
    - Steelsight accuracy increase 40% → 75%

*While one might want to increase the effective range of shotguns, increased accuracy might not always be desireable.*
*Swapping basic and ace allows for increasing shotgun range without messing with accuracy and buffing the accuracy bonus makes it a more useful pick.*

- Overkill
  - Basic
    - Duration 20s → 10s
  - Ace
    - Added 20s duration upgrade

*Overkill's duration is way too long for the strong bonus damage it provides.*
*Moving some of its power to the aced version will force players to engage with enemies more when only using it for shotguns.*

#### Ammo Specialist

- Bullet Storm
  - Now only needs one gun to be fully empty to gain the maximum duration
  - Fixed increased duration when ammo bag was used up
  - Ace
    - Duration 15s → 10s

*Bullet Storm had comically long durations when the bag was used up, outside of that, reaching the full duration was annoying due to needing both guns to be empty.*
*Reducing the requirement to get the maximum duration and slightly reducing the full duration should make the skill feel better.*

- Saw Massacre
  - Basic
    - Reduced wear 50% → 90%
  - Ace
    - Panic chance 50% → 75%

*Saw Massacre is a useless skill and 50% reduced wear is not enough to make the saw a viable weapon against enemies.*
*Decreasing the wear further and increasing the panic chance will make it more viable at least in some cases.*

### Technician

#### Engineer

- Eco Sentry
  - Basic
    - Reduced deploy cost 5% → 10%

*The basic version does exactly the same as the basic version of Third Law, but costs 2 points instead of 1.*
*Giving Eco Sentry a slight boost should allow placing an additional sentry from full ammo in most cases.*

#### Breacher

- Hardware Expert
  - Ace
    - Auto restart chance 10% → 30%

*With the recent change that makes drill roll the chance to auto restart on each break it has become a bit more unpredictable.*
*Upping the chance for the restart to happen should make it more useful.*

- More Firepower
  - Basic
    - Shaped charges 1 → 2
  - Ace
    - Shaped charges 2 → 3

*While the tripmine part of the skill is fine, the amount of shaped charges you get is not really great considering how little use they have on most heists.*
*Increasing the amount from a maximum of 6 to 8 will give the skill more value on heists that have use for shaped charges.*

- Kickstarter
  - Basic
    - Auto restart chance 20% → 30%

*See notes on Hardware Expert.*

- Fire Trap
  - Fixed tripmines placed on walls spawning fire on the walls
  - Basic
    - Base burn duration 10s → 20s
  - Ace
    - Burn duration increase 10s → 20s

*Fire Trap doesn't really feel useful as a top tier skill and you're basically getting a non-replenishable Molotov effect from it.*
*Increasing the burn duration and allowing them to be placed on walls without making the fire useless should make the skill more useful for area denial.*

#### Oppressor

- Heavy Impact
  - Basic
    - Stagger chance 5% → 10%
  - Ace
    - Stagger chance 20% → 30%

*Heavy Impact is a niche skill that is not very useful with the current numbers.*
*Increasing the stagger chance should give it some more use.*

- Body Expertise
  - Basic
    - Damage 30% → 20%
  - Ace
    - Damage 90% → 60%

*Body Expertise simply gives too much value for very low effort.*
*Reducing the damage percentage should bring the skill more in line.*

### Ghost

#### Silent Killer

- Optical Illusions
  - Basic
    - Targeting chance decrease 35% → 20%

*Optical Illusions is a niche skill but it provides slightly too much value when it's used with Jokers.*

- Unseen Strike
  - Basic
    - Crit duration 6s → 4s
  - Ace
    - Crit duration 18s → 12s

*The duration for crits seems a bit too long since you do not lose the bonus on getting hit.*

### Fugitive

#### Gunslinger

- Desperado
  - Basic
    - Now refreshes buff duration on hit
    - Stack boost is now additive
    - Duration 10s → 5s

*Losing the accuracy bonus after a fixed amount of time despite consistently hitting shots didn't really feel good.*
*Refreshing the buff duration on hit but reducing the base duration makes the skill feel better while still providing a good boost to accuracy.*

- Trigger Happy
  - Now refreshes buff duration on hit
  - Stack boost is now additive
  - Basic
    - Damage increase 120% → 25%
    - Max stacks 1 → 4
  - Ace
    - Max stacks 1 → 6

*The Ace version of Trigger happy wasn't really worth it, since all the important stuff was in the basic skill.*
*Increasing the maximum stack size and moving some of the skill's power to the ace version should improve how this skill plays.*

#### Revenant

- Nine Lives
  - Basic
    - Bleedout health increase 50% → 100%

*The percentage value for this skill was still stuck in a time were enemies didn't even deal half as much damage and where the murder tactic was non-functional.*
*Increasing the gained health value should make the basic skill more useful.*

- Up You Go
  - Ace
    - Revive health increase 40% → 100%

*Since this is a multiplier to the health you get on being revived, it did almost nothing on higher difficulties.*
*Increasing it will give you double the revive health which should make it more useful.*

#### Brawler

- Bloodthirst
  - Basic and Ace skill swapped
  - Basic
    - Reload speed duration 10s → 5s
  - Ace
    - Damage increase +100% up to 1600% → +50% up to 800%

*Bloodthirst provides a way too strong bonus for a basic skill that involves no effort to gain as the requirement for it is something you do anyways.*
*Swapping the basic and ace version and reducing the numbers should bring this skill more in line.*

- Berserker
  - Swapped with Frenzy

*Berserker provides a very strong benefit that is a bit too easy to reach in the skilltree.*
*Swapping Berserker and Frenzy makes investing into it a bit more costly.*

- Frenzy
  - Swapped with Berserker

*See notes on Berserker.*

## Perk deck changes

### Crook

- Expert Composure
  - Armor increase 25% → 30%

*Crook could use a slight armor buff to make other ballistic vests more usable.*

### Burglar

- Dutch Courage
  - Pager answer speed 10% → 20%

*Increasing the speed for answering pagers makes Burglar more useful as an alternative for Yakuza as a stealth deck.*

### Infiltrator

- Overdog
  - Melee damage boost duration 7s → 5s

*Overdog's increased damage boost duration seems a bit too high when compared to other damage boosts.*
*Reducing the duration brings it a bit more in line with other damage boosts.*

### Sociopath

- Overdog
  - Renamed back to "No Talk"
  - Added melee damage boost duration upgrade

*When Infiltrator got the melee damage boost duration upgrade, Sociopath was left out and still has only 1s, which is not enough for slower melee weapons.*
*Adding the same duration increase as in Infiltrator should make all melee weapons useful with Sociopath.*

### Gambler

- Medical Supplies
  - Cooldown 3s → 2s

- Ammo Give Out
  - Removed cooldown

*As a team oriented deck, Gambler needs some tweaks to its cooldowns for health and ammo restore to make it more useful.*

### Anarchist

- Lust for Life
  - Armor gain 30 → 20

*The final card description in Anarchist is incorrect and it actually gives 30 armor instead of the stated 10.*
*Slightly reducing the armor gain should still allow decent gains while being a bit more risky.*

### Stoic

- Virtue
  - Damage over time duration 12s → 9s

*Stoic is a very powerful deck as it gives you a lot of time to react to incoming damage, often without even the need to use the flask.*
*Decreasing the time it takes to apply the damage over time will force the usage of the flask more often.*

### Hacker

- Botnet
  - Removed dodge chance bonus

*Hacker has two instances of dodge chance bonuses of 15% each, which makes it a bit too strong.*
*Removing one of those instances should make it more balanced.*

### Leech

- Momentum
  - Number of health segments 5 → 8
  - Teammate heal amount 5% → 3%

- Stalwart
  - Teammate heal amount 10% → 6%

- Symbiosis
  - Number of health segments 10 → 16

*Leech depends heavily on vanilla values of grace period and enemy firing behaviour and as such falls off with lower grace period and enemies firing in full auto.*
*Increasing the number of health segments should improve survivability, while lowering the healing amount keeps the total amount of healing similar to vanilla.*

### Copycat

- Tactical Reload
  - Changed instant swap back to increased swap speed
  - Swap speed duration 3s → 10s
- Head Games
  - No longer heals when Berserker is active
- Grace Period
  - No longer triggers from taking armor damage
- Thriving
  - Health increase 20% → 10%

*The change made to the swapping mechanic leaves a little too short of a time window to swap weapons and looks jarring and buggy.*
*Increasing the duration the bonus is available and changing it back to a swap speed increase makes it more accessible and less prone to bugs.*
*Reducing the health increase brings it more in line with the armor cards and the Grace Period change makes it more reliable.*

## General changes

### Weapons

- All weapons
  - Removed aim assist
  - Rebalanced ammo pickup
  - Made alert ranges consistent
  - Fixed ADS and crouching spread values
  - Made recoil recovery only apply to the last fired shot (Off by default)

*There is a form of aim assist that makes you more likely to hit a target the longer you shoot at it while missing.*
*Removing this aim assist will make it harder to hit enemies at distance with low accuracy weapons.*
*Ammo pickup has been rebalanced based on damage instead of total ammo.*
*Fixed incorrect ADS spread values which lead to crouching having better accuracy than ADS.*

- LMGs
  - Added 15% reduced movement speed penalty
  - Fixed bipods not using separate spread values

*Even after the nerfs LMGs are still very powerful with very little drawbacks.*
*Adding back the movement speed penalty gives a more unique drawback than nerfing stats.*

- Miniguns
  - Added 15% reduced movement speed penalty
  - Added damage falloff
  - Increased damage by 20%

*With the reduced movement speed and added damage falloff, miniguns could use a slight damage buff to justify using them over LMGs.*

- Shotguns
  - Restored original base pellet amount of 12
  - Double Barrel Shotguns
    - Increased damage by 25%
    - Increased reload speed by 50%
  - Buckshot
    - Now reduces pellet amount by 3
  - Tombstone Slug
    - Now reduces pellet amount by 3
    - Stun chance 100% → 25%
    - DoT damage 120 → 40
    - DoT duration 5s → 10s
  - AP Slug
    - Accuracy bonus 8 → 24

*Some shotgun ammo types are clearly superior with no downsides while others struggle to be useful.*
*Adding downsides to the ones that are just free damage and buffing less used ones should make the choice of ammo more impactful.*

- Snipers
  - Rebalanced total ammo

*Snipers have varying ammo pools though vanilla balancing suggests they are all intended to have around the same pool.*
*Rebalancing the values makes the choice of sniper rifle depend less on total ammo pool.*

- Akimbo
  - Set reload speed to roughly 75% of their single variants
  - Set total ammo to their single variants plus one extra magazine

*Certain akimbo weapon stats seem random and inconsistent when compared to their single weapon counterparts.*
*Basing the inconsistent stats on their single variants results in a slight buff for most akimbo pistols and a nerf for most other akimbo weapons.*

- Saws
  - Made damage against Bulldozers multiply base damage instead of a fixed number
  - Made ammo use consistent instead of random
  - Added innate armor piercing

*Saws have a hidden damage increase against Bulldozers that's just a hardcoded damage value.*
*Changing it to be a multiplier of the damage makes modding for damage actually matter.*

- Bows
  - Reduced damage by 50%
  - Reduced charge time by 30%
  - Increased minimum projectile speed to 50%
  - Added innate armor piercing

*Bows don't really feel good to use due to requiring long charge times before being able to fire a usable shot.*
*Allowing bows to be quickly fired without charging and reducing the damage in exchange makes bows more fun to use.*

- Crossbows
  - Added innate armor piercing

*Similar to bows, crossbows are not that fun to use, adding armor piercing should make them feel better.*

- Melee
  - Rebalanced all melee weapons based on speed, concealment and range
  - Reduced charge time by 50%

*There are only a handful of relevant melee weapons and most of the others are arbitrarily balanced.*
*Basing the damage and knockdown of melee weapons on their other stats with the Ice Pick as a reference should make the choice of melee weapon more interesting.*

### Equipment

- ECM Jammer
  - Feedback interval 1.5s → 1s
  - Recharge time 4 min → 3 min

*Tweaking regular ECM feedback should make them more useful for loud gameplay, considering the heavy point investment needed.*
*The change to the interval is a small adjustment to make feedback between Pocket ECM and regular ECM consistent.*

- Armors
  - Increased scaling of armor steadiness

*Steadiness affects the screen-shake when being shot but heavier armors don't reduce it in a very noticable way.*
*Increasing the scaling will make the difference between armors more noticable.*
